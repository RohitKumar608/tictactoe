# Tic-Tac-Toe

We have given a input field you can change and create the matrix of n\*n value enter in the input field(n value enter in the field).
The winner combination we are generating dynamically value entered in the input field.

We have written a method inside utils `generateTicTacToeWinnerComb` method for generating the combination of winner.
